## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
* A free MongoDB Atlas account and a connection string.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/echo.git](https://github.com/your-username/echo.git)
    cd echo
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client # or your frontend folder name
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * In the `server` directory, create a `.env` file and add the following:
        ```
        MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
        JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"
        ```
    * In the `client` (frontend) directory, create a `.env` file and add the URL of your running backend server:
        ```
        VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:3000" 
        ```
        *(Note: If you are using Codespaces, replace with your forwarded port URL)*

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm run dev 
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend development server (in a new terminal):**
    ```bash
    cd client # or your frontend folder name
    npm run dev
    ```

Your application should now be running, with the frontend on `http://localhost:5173` (or your Vite port) and the backend on `http://localhost:3000`.
